Bugs:
- Saves black image to storage when using a different way to process pixels (when using the wrapper for example)
- The toolbar is badly positioned, the page moves up when maximizing the window
- Rotate does not apply for some pixels, it leaves some (~ 3) black lines around the border
- Result Image doesn't show in Windows Light theme, only it shows in Windows Dark theme
